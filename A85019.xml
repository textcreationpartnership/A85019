            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Was ſent unto by the King on Friday laſt, to deſire the Parliament to give way to Him to ſee His Children; and that they might for that purpoſe be ſent to Him: If I may be bold humbly to offer my Opinion, I think the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch a thing may be without the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Kingdom, and yet gain more upon His Majeſty then denying it; and if it be in the prayers of every good man, That His heart may be gained, the performance of ſuch civilities to Him is very ſutable to thoſe Deſires, and will hear well with all men, who (if they can imagine it to be their own caſe) cannot but be ſorry, if His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties natural affections to His Children, in ſo ſmall a thing ſhould not be complyed with; and if any queſtion ſhould be concerning the aſſurance of their return, I ſhall ingage for their return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what time the Parliament ſhall limit.</p>
            <p>Upon this occaſion give me leave, I beſeech you, to take notice of ſome Reports ſpread abroad, as if my ſelf and the Officers of the Army were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome underhand Contract or Bargain with the King; and from thence occaſion is taken to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Integrities, and endeavor a miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the Parliament and their Army, the fidelity of which to the Parliament and Kingdom, and their affection to it, are the great objects of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114322:3"/>mens Envies, becauſe they ſee nothing ſo likely to ſettle Right and Freedom, with Truth and Peace to us and poſterity, &amp; to hinder their Deſigns againſt the ſame, as an Harmony or good accord between the Parliament and Army, which is the joy of good men, and it ſhall be our ſtudy to preſerve againſt all Deſigns and Deſigners to the contrary.</p>
            <p>To prevent therefore all miſunderſtandings of that kinde, I thought fit with all clearneſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto you, That we have done nothing, nor ſhall do any thing which we deſire to hide from you or the world, or ſhall not avow to the faces of our greateſt Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Our Deſires concerning a juſt conſideration and ſettlement of the Kings Rights (His Majeſty firſt giving His concurrence to ſettle and ſecure the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom) We have already publiquely declared in our Repreſentation and Remonſtrance. Since the firſt of thoſe Papers ſent to the Parliament, there have been ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Army upon ſeveral occaſions ſent to His Majeſty, the firſt to preſent to Him a copy of the Repreſentation, and after that ſome others to render Him a copy of the Remonſtrance; upon both which, the Officers ſent were appointed to clear the ſence and intention of any thing in either Paper, whereupon His Majeſty might make any queſtion. Since then, there have alſo been ſome Officers at ſeveral times ſent to His Majeſty about
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114322:3"/>His remove from <hi>Hayfield,</hi> to diſſwade (if poſſibly) from <hi>Windſor</hi> or any place ſo near <hi>London,</hi> to ſome place of further diſtance, anſwerable to what we had deſired of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>In all which addreſſes to His Majeſty. We care not who knows what hath been ſaid or done; for as We have nothing to bargain for or to ask, either from His Majeſty or the Parliament, for advantage to our ſelves, or any particular party or intereſt of our own, ſo in all thoſe Addreſſes to His Majeſty We have utterly diſclaimed and diſavowed any ſuch thing, or any Overtures or Thoughts tending that way; But the onely intent and effect of thoſe our Addreſſes hath been, to deſire and endeavor His Majeſties free concurrence with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for eſtabliſhing and ſecuring the common Rights and Liberties, and ſettling the peace of the Kingdom; and to aſſure Him, That (the Publique being ſo provided for, with ſuch His Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence) it is fully agreeable to our Principles, and ſhould be our deſires and endeavor, That (with, and in ſuch ſettling of the Publique) the Rights of His Majeſties Royal Family ſhould be alſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, ſo as a laſting Peace and Agreement might be ſettled in this Nation: And that, as We had publiquely declared for the ſame in general terms, ſo (if things came to a way of ſettlement) We ſhould not be wanting (in our ſphaeres) to own that general Deſire, in any particulars of natural or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil right to His Majeſties Perſon or Family, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114322:4"/>might not prejudice or again indanger the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: and in the mean time, That His Majeſty ſhould finde all perſonal civilities and reſpects from us, with all reaſonable freedom that might ſtand with ſafety, and with the truſt or charge lying upon us concerning His Perſon.</p>
            <p>You have here the utmoſt ſum of what hath paſs'd from us to His Majeſty; and We could wiſh all men did rightly underſtand (without miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations) every particular wherein (as We know nothing not agreeable to Reaſon, Juſtice, Honeſty or Conſcience, ſo) We thought our ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the rather to ſay and do, as We have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards His Majeſty ſince He came within our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, becauſe of thoſe common prejudices ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt us, as if We were utter Enemies to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and all Civil Order or Government.</p>
            <p>And for that particular of the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> and the Two Chapleins lately permitted to attend His Majeſty, It was not done without much relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy, becauſe therein We doubted We might be miſunderſtood by the Kingdoms beſt friends.</p>
            <p>But upon His Majeſties continuing importunity for it (as a thing very nearly concerning His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inward and outward contentment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thoſe perſons ſuch (as we hoped) would not do ill offices to prejudice the Peace of the Kingdom, We did give way to it, and the perſons (before they came) had notice of the permiſſion: And as We then thought, ſo We ſtill do think,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114322:4"/>That to allow him ſome ſuch company of perſons leaſt dangerous, whom former acquaintance may make him take pleaſure in; and the allowance of ſome ſuch Chapleins of His own, are things both reaſonable and juſt; and the debarring of that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the latter (We doubt) will but make Him more prejudiced againſt other Miniſters.</p>
            <p>In general, We humbly conceive, that to avoid all harſhneſs, and afford all kinde uſage to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon, in things conſiſting with the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom, is the moſt Chriſtian, Honorable and Prudent way: And in all things (as the Repreſentation and Remonſtrance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my doth expreſs) We think that tender, equitable and moderate dealing, both towards His Majeſty, His Royal Family, and His late party (ſo far as may ſtand with ſafety to the Kingdom, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our common Rights and Liberties) is the moſt hopeful courſe to take away the ſeeds of War or future Feuds amongſt us for poſterity, and to procure a laſting Peace and Agreement in this now diſtracted Nation; To the effecting and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof (with a ſecure proviſion firſt to be made for the common Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, and a due care to preſerve and propagate the Goſpel of Truth &amp; Peace amongſt us) we ſhall hope that neither the Parliament nor His Majeſty will be wanting: And if God ſhall ſee it good to make us any way inſtrumental thereunto, or that We may otherwiſe ſee the ſame accompliſht, We
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114322:5"/>ſhall then think our ſelves indeed diſcharged from the publique ingagements We have been called out unto, more clearly and effectually then (before ſuch things were ſettled) We could have though our ſelves to be, and (to demonſtrate our clearneſs from ſeeking ſelf-advantages in what We did) We ſhall thenceforth account it our greateſt happineſs and Honor (if God ſee it good) to be diſingaged and diſmiſt, not onely from our Military charges, but from all other matters of Power or publique imployment whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I have in theſe things ſpoke, not in my own Name alone, but in the Name (becauſe I finde it to be the clear ſence of the generality, or at leaſt of the moſt conſiderable part) of the Army, and I am confident you and the Kingdom will never finde it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: I ſhall leave it to your favorable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and commit all to the goodneſs of God for an happy iſſue. I remain</p>

And to the end that nothing may be wanting in us which might work toward the ſpeedie ſettlement of the quiet of this Kingdom; we have humbly offered what we can ſay will moſt effectually tend to remove
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114322:6"/>thoſe incumbrances and letts which ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the univerſal good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and till that be done, it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we ſhould procure the Peace of this Kingdom by a Treaty, but rather give occaſion and opportunity thereby to others to engage us in a ſecond War, which muſt neceſſarily hazard the ruine of this Kingdom, as alſo the certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the relief whereof we ſhoud moſt effectually apply unto you, were the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>England</hi> but once put into an hopeful poſture.

            <p>THat finding the Expectation of the Parliament and Kingdom to be very great upon the ſpeedy progreſſe and happie iſſue of this Treaty; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, we have made it our Care conſtantly to attend at the appointed times of meeting, and to preſſe all diſpatch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And we cannot but take notice that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings on your part have been and are very ſlowe, and that little or nothing hath been done in the Treaty ſince our entrance thereupon: and therefore in diſcharge of our Duty, and the Truſt repoſed in us, we do very earneſtly deſire that the Treaty may be effectually proceeded on with all expedition, and the times for meeting punctually kept; there being nothing that ſhall be wanting in us, according to the power given us, to further a work of ſo great importance, and which may perfect a right underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Parliament and the Army.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer of the Commiſſioners of the Army to the Paper of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Parliament about a ſpeedie proceeding.</head>
            <p>BY the laſt Paper delivered in unto us from your Lordſhips at <hi>Reading</hi> the 7 of <hi>July,</hi> we perceive you finde, That the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parliament and Kingdom is great upon the ſpeedie progreſſe and happie iſſue of this Treatie. We anſwer, That we do really apprehend the ſame things with you; neither can we but witneſſe that you have conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the appointed times of meeting, and preſt diſpatch therein: Nevertheleſſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be very ſenſible, that you ſeem to reflect upon us further then there is juſt cauſe, in your taking notice that the proceedings herein ſhould be ſlowe and dilatory on our part, as if we ſhould not ſeem to deſire and labour the quick and ſpeedie ſettlement of the affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a ſafe and well-grounded Peace as cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as any perſons whatſoever. We ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſire you to remember with what forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we have in the firſt place preſented to you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114322:8"/>thoſe things which we did in our hearts conceive neceſſary in order to a Treaty, and without which being granted, we could not with ſafety to the Kingdom and ſatisfaction to our ſelves proceed in Treaty; and further preſt you to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to the Parliament with ſpeed, that a quick diſpatch might be had therein, as being in our thoughts the chiefeſt and ſureſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the engaging this Kingdom in a ſecond War; when contrary to our expectation we have found little effectually done in relation to our Deſires in thoſe things moſt concerning the ſafety and peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore wee may acquit our ſelves from being guilty of the delay you mention, and that it may appear to all men where the ſtick is of not proceeding in the Treaty to a ſettlement of the peace of the Kingdome ſo much thirſted after by us all, we thought fit to reminde you of theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing propoſals, which we have formerly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon, and to which ſatisfaction is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> That there is nothing done with effect, notwithſtanding the Votes of the Houſe, to the diſperſing of the Reformado Officers, who ſtill continue in and about London, ready to head Forces, to the apparent hazzard of a new Warre.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114322:8"/>
                  <hi>II.</hi> That notwithſtanding the Votes of the Houſe for the ſpeedy ſending into Ireland, or disbanding thoſe Forces which left the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and their ſpeciall Order to the Committee at Derby Houſe to take ſpeedy care therein, yet they are ſtill continued in bodies in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout London, and as wee hear, are daily li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting more Forces, pretending the Service of Ireland.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>III.</hi> That notwithstanding the Votes of the Houſe of the tenth of June, and thoſe ſince of the fifth of July, for the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the of Houſe, yet divers perſons compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe Votes continue ſtill to ſit there.</item>
            </list>
            <p>So long as wee remain unſatisfied in the two firſt of theſe particulars, wee cannot be ſecured from thoſe doubts we have expereſſed of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a new Warre, eſpecially if it be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the end of inviting ſo many Reformado Officers to <hi>London,</hi> was to lay a foundation of a new Warre, and was principally carried on by the deſigne of ſome of thoſe Members of the Houſe of Commons we have impeached. And likewiſe that divers of the Officers and Souldiers which left this Army were procured by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114322:9"/>of pay, and other ingagements, which were likewiſe deſigned by the ſame perſons aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if poſſibly they might thereby have broken this Army.</p>
            <p>And for the laſt; What comfortable effect may wee expect of a Treaty, ſo long as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (the ſupreme Judicatory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) is conſtituted of ſome that are men of intereſts contrary to the common good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, from whom wee can expect nothing but banding and deſigning, to obſtruct and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all proceedings. (contrary to their intereſt) though never ſo eſſentiall to the happy ſettlement of the Kingdome: and if a ſeaſonable remedy be not given herein, wee deſpair of any good to the Kingdome by way of Treaty.</p>
